The Virtual Dispatch System (VDS) is the section of vAMSYS where various operational aspects of a VA are managed, including aircraft, airports, routes, stands, load factors, and containers.

## Dashboard

The VDS dashboard provides an overview of key statistics and data for the VA:

- **Statistics**:
    - Number of Airports in the VA
    - Number of Aircraft in the VA
    - Number of Routes in the VA
    - Bookings made over the last 30 days

## Tables

The dashboard includes two main tables:

- **Popular Aircraft**: Lists the most frequently booked aircraft over the last 30 days.
- **Popular Airports**: Lists the most popular airports based on arrivals, departures, and total movements.

## VA Staff Access

At the bottom of the dashboard, there is a list of VA Staff members who have access to the VDS. Access to the VDS is granted by enabling the 'Can Access VDS' permission in the Orwell staff settings and configuring specific VDS access permissions as detailed in the VDS Settings section of Orwell.
