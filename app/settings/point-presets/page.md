In vAMSYS, PIREP Point Presets allow VA staff to quickly apply frequently awarded or deducted points during PIREP (Pilot Report) review. This feature saves time by eliminating the need to write the same comments repeatedly, ensuring consistency and efficiency in your Standard Operating Procedures (SOP).

Point Presets are predefined points that can be added to or deducted from a PIREP. These presets are used to standardize the scoring process, making it quicker and easier for staff to review PIREPs and apply consistent scoring.

**Note:** Point Presets are not applied automatically. They can only be added to PIREPs manually by staff during the review process, which is a different approach from Automated Scoring Rules and Scoring Groups.
