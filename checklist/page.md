        description: Our guide to getting your Virtual Airline up and running on vAMSYS.
---
Whether you are brand new to Virtual Airlines or an experienced veteran - we are thrilled to welcome you on board.

Setting up a Virtual Airline on vAMSYS can be a bit daunting - we will not lie - it is not quick and simple where you can click two buttons and call it done. vAMSYS is complex and has many options, but we’re here to make the process as easy as possible. 

Follow the instructions provided, and don’t rush or skip steps. Complete all the items listed in order to avoid running into problems.

vAMSYS has been providing services for close to 10 years, we had thousands of Virtual Airline owners take the journey to starting a VA, so we must  **stress it again - do not rush, do not skip steps**.



## Before we begin
### Outline of VA Setup Steps and Timeline
Setting up your VA in vAMSYS is not going to be completed in an afternoon. We have prepared a setup plan for you which will take you from zero to hero in 6 days. Take your time to do things right, not fast.
- Day 1 - Initial airline setup and aircraft type configuration
- Day 2 - Remaining configuration, Aircraft Scorers
- Day 3 - Routes
- Day 4 - Events and more advanced concepts
- Day 5 - Working with Importers/Exporters
- Day 6+ Trialing vAMSYS to see if it fits your needs

### Basics of vAMSYS
We will use terms which may be unfamiliar to you throught this checklist - Orwell, VDS, Phoenix, Hangar - please check [Key Features and Key Terms](https://dev.docs.vamsys.dev/#key-features-and-responsibilities) before continuing.

### Join our Discord
Consider joining our Discord.

It’s where we make important announcements, engage in discussions, and where you can ask questions. Discord is our primary means of communication between Team vAMSYS and Virtual Airlines.

Our Discord is open to VA Owners and Staff Members only - join the community [here](https://discord.gg/aAVfmwcx56).

If your VA has a discord - or you plan to make one - please consider subscribing to messages on these channels:
- #announcements - should be visible to Pilots of your Discord. Downtime, maintenance and other important messages applicable to all users of vAMSYS
- #platform-changes - can be public or visible to your team only - we will post vAMSYS changes and new feature announcements there.
- #staff-announcements - should be visible to your VA Staff only. Contains somewhat sensible announcements which do not need all pilots notified.

### Seeking Help and Support
This documentation should have you covered - please ensure you checked all the instructions for each step - but if something goes wrong:
- Discord has #questions channel where you can ask questions
- Our support is always open - you can submit a ticket via Orwell

We ask you to be detailed in your messages and provide us enough information to help you.
