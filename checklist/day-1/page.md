        description: Day 1 new VA Checklist where we will go over the starting steps of configuring vAMSYS for you
---

We will go over the first basic steps of configuring your Virtual Airline.

It is only Day 1, so we will skip a lot and we will not cover every toggle, button and switch you encounter - we will
introduce new features of vAMSYS to you as time goes on.

Do not rush, do not enable anything we don't ask you yet - trust us - it will make it easier for you in the beginning.

## Your First Visit

Upon logging into your VA on vAMSYS you will be presented with this popup
![Starting Location](/new-va/day-1-starting-location.png)

This is a notification every pilot will see upon joining your Virtual Airline - it is prompting you to select your Hub
and starting airport. We have covered the concept of [Pilot Movement](/concepts/users-and-pilots#pilot-movement) more in depth at the linked page - please have a read to understand how Pilot location works in vAMSYS.

We will get to setting up hubs another day - for now **click the 'Take me to Orwell' button**.
