We are at the very end of the VA Setup. Couple things we have not covered yet:

## Importers/Exporters
Accessible to Staff with correct [Permissions](/orwell/staff#data-settings) and active from day 5 of the trial.

Importers are an advanced feature and **are not suitable for everyone**. Please follow the [Manual](/data) very carefully.

## Rest of the Documentation
There are several areas we did not touch in this guide - Pilot Sharing Agreements, Discord Bot, Protocol API etc - feel free to explore this document site at your leisure - you will find descriptions for all features of vAMSYS.

## Leaving Trial
Once you have set up the VA and once you are happy that it fits your needs - proceed to start your subscription to vAMSYS at Billing page accessible via Orwell.

Please note expired VA trials cannot be recreated - we remove the data immediately after the trial expires.
