        description: Day 4 checklist for new VAs - we will look at Events and other Modules
---

We are nearing the end and have gone over all the core functionality - all that's left to explore now are some extra bits and pieces of vAMSYS.

## NOTAMs
We already looked at [NOTAMs](/orwell/announcements#notams) earlier - if you wish to enable/disable them - you can do so at Orwell -> Settings -> Airline -> Modules

## Events
You can use [Events](/orwell/events) to incentivize your pilots to fly somewhere by giving them extra points. vAMSYS has many configuration options for Events. They too can be enabled in Modules.

Please note, managing events requires a [Staff Permission](/orwell/staff#event-settings).

## Leaderboard
Should you wish to enable Pilot leaderboards, you can do it at Orwell -> Settings -> Airline -> Modules

## Badges
A slightly different pilot reward functionality - instead of points it awards [Badges](/orwell/badges) for milestone achievements.

Please note, managing badges requires a Staff Permission.

## Hangar
Hangar - our opinionated file storage solution has it's dedicated section [here](/hangar).

## Day 5
Lastly, proceed to [Day 5](/checklist/day-5)
