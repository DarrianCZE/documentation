Once 3 days have passed - the Route options in VDS will unlock.

You should also already have the requisite permissions to work with routes in VDS, have created all fleets and added all your airports.

## VDS
### Route Management -> Routes
Start by making a route from the Airport located in the Hub you made in [Day 1](/checklist/day-1#airport-management-hubs).

More information on Routes and various related pages is available [here](/vds/routes).

Once you made the route - it will appear in Phoenix to book in a minute or two (provided you did not set it to start in the future and the route departs from the airport are you in). In Phoenix you can navigate to Flight Centre -> Book Flight - the route you made will show up there.

Use the rest of the day, rest of the trial in fact, to add your remaining routes, aircraft and airports.

## Test Flight
When ready - download Pegasus from the ACARS page you created - fire it up, select your VA, start tracking and record a flight.

During the flight you will see yourself show up in Flight List and the Flight Map.

Once you file the PIREP, it will apply the AutoReject rules and PIREP Scorers you've set up yesterday.

## Reviewing your PIREP
Once Filed, the PIREP will show in your pilot profile as well as in Orwell. If AutoReject actions you configured sent the PIREP to review - it will show up in the awaiting review list.

We explained all PIREP related actions [here](/orwell/liveries-pireps)
