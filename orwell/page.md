Orwell, named after George Orwell, serves as the 'supervisor' and administrative hub within the vAMSYS ecosystem. It is the central area where all crucial settings are configured, impacting how Phoenix, VDS, and other vAMSYS subsystems function. Within Orwell, you can manage pilot lists, post NOTAMs and Alerts, review Liveries and PIREPs, set Scoring rules, and handle Pages, Ranks, and Badges, among other configuration and design settings.

## Orwell Dashboard
The Orwell Dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of your VA operations and statistics. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the key features:

- **Pilot Statistics:** Track various metrics such as the number of pilots, PIREPs, points, flight time, passengers, cargo, fuel used, and distance flown. Filters are available for Today, Last 24 Hours, Yesterday, Last 30 Days, Year to Date, Last Year, and All Time. Statistics are updated every hour.
- **Your Links & Info:** Contains your VA Identifier, which is essential for joining our Discord or contacting Support. Once your VA is launched and the subscription is active, this section will also include Register and Login links for your pilots.
- **Support:** Provides links to essential resources and support options:
  - **Discord:** Access the Owner and Staff Discord.
  - **Changelog & Developer Portal:** Stay updated with system changes and access developer resources.
  - **Manual:** View the system documentation.
  - **Protocol:** Access the API documentation.
  - **Vision:** Submit bug reports and suggestions.
  - **Helpdesk:** Get additional support as needed.
- **Live Flights Table:** Displays all active flights within your VA, including details such as Pilot name and Username, Flight Callsign, Departure and Arrival Airports, Aircraft in use, ETE/EDT, Remaining Distance, Flight Status, and whether the flight is being conducted Offline or on an Online Network. This list updates every minute. Buttons on the right-hand side provide quick access to the Flight Map and the Pilot's public profile.
- **Recent Bookings:** Lists bookings made in the last 24 hours, helping you keep track of new activities and engagements from your pilots.
- **New Registrations:** Shows registrations over the last 7 days. This table includes two quick actions: 'Capitalize Name' (converting names to proper capitalization, e.g., john doe to John Doe) and 'Send Name for Review' (flagging potential fake names for review by Team vAMSYS, as using fake names is against vAMSYS ToS).
