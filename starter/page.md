title: New Virtual Airline Checklist
---
{% callout type="warning" title="Work In Progress!" %}
Documentation is work in progress. If you notice discrepancies between documentation here and reality on vAMSYS, please let us know in Discord so we can fix it.
{% /callout %}
We are thrilled to have you on board.

Setting up a Virtual Airline on vAMSYS can seem daunting, but weâ€™re here to make the process as easy as possible. Follow the instructions provided, and donâ€™t rush or skip steps (unless youâ€™re already running a VA with us ðŸ˜„â€”thank you for creating another VA!). Complete all the items listed to avoid running into problems.

## Join our Discord

Before proceeding, your first task is to join our Discord.

We require all VA Owners to be part of our Discord. Itâ€™s where we make important announcements, engage in discussions, and where you can ask questions. Discord is our primary means of communication between Team vAMSYS and Virtual Airlines.

Our Discord is open to VA Owners and Staff Members only.

### Basic Requirements for Discord Access

To get access to all channels, please ensure you request a nickname change if you havenâ€™t joined with the correct naming scheme. Post a message in #nickname-changes with your username formatted as follows:

- **Primary VA Owner:**  
  **FirstName - VA Identifier - Owner**  
  *Example:* **John - HTB101 - Owner**

- **VA Staff Member:**  
  **FirstName - VA Identifier - Staff**  
  *Example:* **John - HTA100 - Staff**

**Do Not** request a nickname change to your Pilot ID. For instance, "Lukas - HTA0002" is incorrect. Many VA Owners and Staff make this mistakeâ€”save yourself some embarrassment and avoid being that person.

You can find your VA Identifier in the Orwell Dashboard.

Team vAMSYS administers ranks to VA Owners. VA Owners are responsible for role management for their Staff.

Now, put this into practice and join the community [here](https://discord.gg/aAVfmwcx56).

## Checklist

Once youâ€™ve joined our Discord, let's start with the steps you need to takeâ€”in the order they are listed (trust us!).

If you havenâ€™t yet, please familiarize yourself with [key terms](/#key-terms).

Promise yourself that you will not rush. We are not trying to be patronizing, but our experience with many VAs launching using vAMSYS has shown that most issues arise from VA Owners rushing through the process or delegating tasks to their Staff without proper training or instructions. Rest easyâ€”you wonâ€™t be adding any routes on Day 1 or making any flights. Take your time to do things right, not fast.

### Day 1, Part 1

### Day 2, Part 2

### Day 14, Part 3
