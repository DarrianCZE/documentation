## What is Hangar?

Hangar is our comprehensive solution to Virtual Airline storage needs, offering a versatile platform for storing and managing various types of files and resources. Whether it's checklists, documents, PFPX profiles, liveries, or any other custom tools, Hangar provides a robust system to manage all your Virtual Airline's assets.

Unlike typical object storage systems, Hangar offers a complete file management and versioning system tailored specifically for both pilots and VA staff. It features version control, image support, descriptions, authorship attribution, download tracking, and access restrictions.

## Key Features

### Features for Virtual Airlines

Hangar surpasses common storage solutions like Google Drive, Dropbox, and OneDrive by offering features specifically tailored for Virtual Airlines. Each File in Hangar is more than just a file; it includes:

- **Human-readable titles and descriptions:** Clearly labeled and described Files make it easy to understand their purpose and content.
- **Authorship attribution:** Files are credited to their Authors and Sources.
- **Images and metadata:** Files can include images and be associated with specific Simulators or Addons.
- **Version control:** Easily update Files with new Versions. For example, if you update an A320 checklist, you can add it as version 1.1, and all pilots who have previously downloaded it will be notified of the update.
- **Access restrictions:** Only your Virtual Pilots can download the Files, ensuring your resources are protected from unauthorized sharing.

### Features for Pilots

Hangar is designed with pilots in mind, offering user-friendly features such as:

- **Advanced filters:** Quickly find Files by Simulator (e.g., XP 12, MSFS 2020) or Addon (e.g., PMDG 737, Fenix A320).
- **Packs:** Download sets of related Files in one go, saving time and effort.
- **Download tracking:** Stay informed about updates to the Files you have downloaded.

### Future of Hangar

Hangar is a dynamic part of the vAMSYS ecosystem, continually evolving to meet the needs of Virtual Airlines. We are committed to ongoing development and enhancement, driven by user feedback and new ideas from the Virtual Airline community.
