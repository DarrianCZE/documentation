In vAMSYS, PIREP Comment Presets allow VA staff to quickly add frequently used comments during PIREP (Pilot Report) review. This feature saves time by eliminating the need to write the same comments repeatedly, ensuring consistency and efficiency in your Standard Operating Procedures (SOP).

Comment Presets are predefined comments that can be added to a PIREP. These presets are used to standardize the review process, making it quicker and easier for staff to review PIREPs and provide consistent feedback.
